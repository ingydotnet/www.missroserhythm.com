In this class, students will learn different parts of the same songs and then play them together as an ensemble. Singing, strumming, picking &amp; chord melody will all be explored. We'll work through a few select songs. It’s about quality, not quantity. Parts will be available for advanced beginners on up; students should be comfortable singing &amp; strumming while changing chords smoothly. Please bring your uke tuned GCEA. Low G is recommended, but not required. Baritones are welcome, but please let instructor know in advance. We'll showcase what we've learned at a class party.
